# v2.1.0 (unreleased)
---------------------

## Improvements

- Test against Python 3.4 using Travis
- Build with `pyproject.toml` and `setuptools`, removing old `setup.py`.
- Convert testing library to `pytest` (from `nose`).

## API changes

- Properties on `CameraModel` (e.g. `cam.M`) are deprecated and will
  be removed in a future release.

- Intrinsic parameter matrix is normalized upon loading in
  `CameraModel._from_parts`, which is called by most constructors.

- If an input calibration has a non-normalized P matrix and a
  rectification matrix, a warning is given as this case is not well
  tested and the behavior should be considered undefined.

## Bugfixes

- Mirroring and flipping cameras with skew, distortion, and
  rectification work now.
